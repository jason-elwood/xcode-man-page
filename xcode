.TH man 1 "13 June 2022" "1.0" "Xcode man page"
.SH NAME
xcode \- A cheat sheet for Xcode users.
.SH SYNOPSIS
Rather than the traditional options list you would find in a Terminal program
manual, this manual will use the following syntax that should help you search for
the commands and features you want: (The commands are in long hand which I hope
helps readability.)

As a reminder, type "/" and enter a word or part of a word to search this
document.

.B Display Interface 
[ Command + Control + Up Arrow ] 
.br
.B Toggle Breakpoint           
[ Command + Backslash ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Xcode does not come installed with a manual page (and why should it?). This file attempts to be a
reference for some of Xcode's more common and lesser know keyboard shortcuts,
useful features, etc.. In essence I hope in time it will become the man page we
never got with Xcode.
